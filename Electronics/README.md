# Intent
Develop electronics to control and monitor aircraft systems that are not related to the avionics and autopilot system.  A stretch goal will be to have this system communicate over and log data the same data the Garmin system logs.

# Requirements
* Items Monitored
   - Power consumption on individual components - lights, autopilot, starter, etc
   - Flight controls position monitoring - stick inputs and control system outputs
   - Control of external cameras - integration with GoPros
   - Engine power output measurement - create in flight system for directly measuring engine torque similar to dyno
   - Engine monitoring - monitor engine and log
   - Battery monitoring - track aircraft battery and take actions accordingly
* Constant evaluation of aircraft performance
* Sensors to output digital data onto communications bus
* Sensors communicate with robust realtime system
