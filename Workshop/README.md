# Workshop
I do not currently have the space to build an aircraft.  A specialized workshop will be constructed for this project.  Design documents will be kept here.  

# Aircraft Component Size:
* Fuselage - 15' 6" x 18' 8"
* Wing - 14' 0" x 7' 10"
* Conard - 6' 5" x 1' 9"

# Expected Size
Minimum footprint size would be 20' x 24'.  This would have to allow for the fuselage + 2' all around for walking room.  Wings and canards have a smaller footprint than the fuelage.  This estimate includes the engine and prop mounted to the fuselage.

# Requirements
* Adequate space for access to all sides of each individual major piece of the aircraft:
  - Fueselage + Prop
  - Wing
  - Conard
  - Engine
* Centrailized work surface that is adjustable height
* Significant workbench space with specialized areas:
  - Epoxy / resin mixing
  - Mechanical work
  - Electronics work
  - Computer work station
* Storage space for entire aircraft in pieces
* Overhead lifting capability
* Overhead drop of power and air
* Substantial overhead light
* 220 V power available
* Air filtration for dust
* Covers for dust protection for sensative components
* Copius cabinets for storage
* Heated and cooled
* Entire wall to be able to be removed to transport aircraft
* Rolling tool chest with work surface on top
* Trays to change out tool bench focus - composites/assembly/electrical
