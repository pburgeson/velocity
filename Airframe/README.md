# Airframe
Airframe for the aircraft will be the Velocity XL, kit produced by Velocity Aircraft in Sebastian, FL.  If I'm going to all the effort and money of building a kit, then it ought to be the one I really want, the larger faster aircraft.

# Requirements
* Fixed gear
* Integrated electric deicing capability - leading edges, wind screen, prop

* Integrated camera mounting - mulitple views
* Push/pull rods for control surfaces

* Eye catching paint / wrap
