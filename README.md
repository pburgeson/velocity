# Velocity
Develop, construction, and flight testing of a Velocity aircraft.

## Background
Velocity is a canard style experimental aircraft available as a kit from [Velocity Aircraft](https://www.velocityaircraft.com/) in Sebastian, FL.  I chose a Velocity SE as my aircraft for several reasons:
1. Experimental means I can build and maintain myself and not be limitied to type certificated parts
2. High cruising speeds for a single engine aircraft
3. Canard style aircraft are nearly impossible to stall
4. The XL is largest cabin available for a single engine aircraft
5. Excellent visibitity and access for both left seat and right seat
6. Opportunity to use a different engine than the standard aviation engines
7. Styling makes for a unique aircraft

This is a very long term project as I am not expecting to start construction until I retire.  Planning can carry on until then.
